    I am a rising freshman at Georgia Tech majoring in computer science. I graduated from Chattahoochee High School in May/June 2019. I am apart of the Google CSSI 2019 program that is directed towards students who just graduated from high school to learn more about Computer Science. My hobbies include reading, watching Netflix (where my favorite shows are Scandal, Dexter, and Greys Anatomy), and hanging out with friends. I also love Ariana Grande a lot and would love for her name to be included on this page.

  <h3> Why we made this website </h3>
  <p>
    Our app is meant for people who are eating at fast food restaurants who have dietary restricitons. Instead of having to take the time to look up individual items from the menue online, the user will have their options listed for them based on the restauruant they are eating at and their dietary restriction. While this website is just a prototype, the finished product of this website would have many more restaurant options and food items per restaurant.
